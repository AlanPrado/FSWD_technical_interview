# Project - `Technical Interview Practice`

This project consists in questions and answers about algorithms and complexity (time / space).

## How the project is structured?

This project has two files:

```
+-- explanations.txt // Contains explanations about how each solution was build and an evaluation of its complexity.
+-- solutions.py     // Has the implementations of each algorithm, beyond its tests cases.
```

Each solutions is named like question{1-5} and you can find the question description at its pydoc section.

## How to test this project?

Run `python solutions.py` and test cases should be executed.
